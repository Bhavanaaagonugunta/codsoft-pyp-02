This Python program is a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

### Key Components:

1. **Functions**: 
   - `add(x, y)`, `subtract(x, y)`, `multiply(x, y)`, and `divide(x, y)` handle arithmetic operations.
   - `divide(x, y)` includes a check to prevent division by zero.

2. **User Interaction**:
   - The user selects an operation (1-4) and inputs two numbers.
   - The program calculates and displays the result.

3. **Loop for Multiple Calculations**:
   - The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.

This simple calculator is easy to use, handles basic arithmetic, and includes safeguards against errors like division by zero.
